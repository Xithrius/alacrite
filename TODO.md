# Starting again

- [x] How to read and write files
- [x] TOML Config encoding/decoding
- [ ] File structure of go projects
- [ ] Formatters, linters, CI


# Perhaps reconsider

- [ ] Pick the package (or std) implementation for the HTTP server
- [ ] Make sure requests work through tests
- [ ] Find a way to implement the frontend (CLI and/or web)
- [ ] Implement webhooks onto the server such that clients can be notified of changes
- [ ] Use [minio](https://github.com/minio/minio-go/) to do object storage with config files
